    <updated>2012-02-02T11:11:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pzol.github.com/pzol/blog/2012/02/02/object-oriented-acceptance-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is part two of my blog post about Acceptance Testing. In the previous post I outlined some basics, now let&#8217;s get into the code.</p>

<h2>A real life example</h2>

<p>The tests I will be showing you are based on a real-life example, which I have (vastly) simplified for this article. Here is a picture how it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://pzol.github.com/pzol/downloads/transaction_browser.png"></p>

<p>The source code for the test application is available at <a href="https://github.com/pzol/acceptance_testing">https://github.com/pzol/acceptance_testing</a></p>

<h2>Know your tools</h2>

<p>If you want to dive deep into acceptance testing, you can skip this part.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='automates fast feedback from the first minute '>
In order to be productive and not waste time with repeating tasks, I find it very important to setup an environment which automates fast feedback from the first minute about what is going on in your application and your tests.
</span></p>

<p>The tools I use here are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">Rspec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> - for running specs as they change</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> - to help testing the web application</li>
</ul>


<p>This is how my <code>.rspec</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>--color
--format progress
--fail-fast
</code></pre>

<p>This will format the output in color, display the output in dots (progress) format and most importantly turn on fail-fast, which will stop the tests at the first error!</p>

<p>For running single tests via Guard, I can override this options in the Guardfile</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Guardfile</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">guard</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rspec&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:version</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:cli</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;--format nested&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:notification</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">%r{^spec/.+_spec\.rb$}</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can run the application under test using  <code>bundle exec rackup</code><br/>
then go with your browser to <code>http://localhost:9292</code></p>

<h2>Test Data</h2>

<p>As the system shall test the application end-to-end we need some test data, I have actually exported from a real database and saved as json</p>

<h2>My ideal acceptance test</h2>

<p>This is how I imagine an <em>acceptance test</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>sunny_day.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">scenario</span> <span class="s1">&#39;latest transactions&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">TestUser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Role</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">TransactionsBrowser</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">visit_latest_transactions</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sees_transactions_table!</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sees_transactions_table!</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all_table_rows</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">tr</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">tr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timestamp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">be_a</span> <span class="no">DateTime</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Although I generally recommend not to clutter your scenario with shoulds or asserts, sometimes having them means is faster and means much less code. Not having them adds the minor benefit, that you are not depending on a particular testing framework.</p>

<h2>The TestUser class</h2>

<p>It represents the Data in DCI. For the RSpec I create an empty class and add the <code>Capybara::DSL</code> as well as the <code>Capybara::RSpecMatchers</code>. Those will make available all the nice Capybara and RSpec matchers within the <code>TestUser</code> class and also to its instances.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>test_user.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestUser</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The TransactionBrowser Role</h2>

<p>It contains all the role methods which a person browsing the transactions might do. <br/>
The transactions page contains a list of transactions which have been sent to some API.</p>

<p>By calling <code>user.sees_transactions_table!</code> I define that the user sees the table. We intuitively know what it means to see that table and if it is alright. So mapping this to my mental model I only have this terse command with the bang! at the end, which means this is an <em>assertion</em>.  Inside this method I describe what it means, that the table is displayed correctly.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>What is very important here, that we verify, that we have the correct page loaded and if not to display the error message in the test results, otherwise you will be doing a lot of &#8216;puts-driven-development&#8217;.</p>

<p>I know that Sinatra displays its error in the <code>#summary</code> div, so I pick just this to be shown in my test results, Capybara nicely strips all the html around, so it is very readable in the console:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Next I verify all the table rows:</p>

<p>Ok, now that we are done with the basic sunny day scenario, we need the user to be able to search. Writing the scenario first.</p>

<p>I can reuse easily the a lot of the code I used earlier. The new thing here is <code>user.searches_for_time_taken(time_taken = 20000)</code>. This will hide the ugly details of filling boxes and clicking, and is so much more readable.<br/>
I consciously am <strong>not</strong> checking for the count of rows as in the first example. I am verifying only what makes this scenario successful, which is the time_taken. This makes the tests also less brittle in case I decide to change the underlying test data later.</p>

<p>I introduce a new role <code>Role::TimeTakenSearcher</code>.</p>

<h2>Browser-less web-development promotes reliable acceptance tests</h2>

<p>While writing the accompanying application for this article, I decided <strong>not</strong> to open the browser, especially when errors occurred. It was difficult at first, but in the end it saved me a lot of time and it made my tests so much more reliable. It forced me to have more descriptive error messages.</p>

<h2>A word about test-speed</h2>

<p>I am a fan of <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a>, every time I save it runs the test I am working on in the background and notifies me by Growl if the test passed or not. Thus fast feedback is important for my workflow.</p>

<p>A single test should run fast, always, by that I mean less than 500 ms. On top of that comes the startup time. For Sinatra and Padrino that&#8217;s usually 2-3 secs, for Rails&#8230; well&#8230; you might want to use Spork there.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s another reason why you should have an object oriented design in your code, so you can use regular unit tests</p>

<p>Please do include unit test. Acceptance test show you if the system as a whole is working, but as they see it only from the user&#8217;s point of view, they may not show you where the system is broken.</p>

<h2>Remember the rules</h2>

<p>When I write a new page, I start with the <strong>outside-inside</strong> principle (or also called feature injection) and <strong>TDD</strong>. I create a test, describing what I expect the page to look like. Then I write the view in html or haml to make the test pass. Only then start replacing the mockup of the page with logic!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I work a lot on Acceptance Tests and how to write them in a clean way.
When working with <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/">Capybara</a> I often see people wanting to go to a page and then do a couple of tests. The intent is to go to the site, login, then <em>describe</em> what they see, which is good practice (at least in theory).</p>

<p>Something like this (which I consider spaghetti coding anyway, but nice for the purpose of illustration):</p>

<p>Trouble is that Capybara will by default reset your session after each test. Bummer!
If you look at the Capybara source code you will find this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/rspec.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The OO Solution</h2>

<p>I am currently working on another more longish article which will be about <strong>Beautiful Acceptance Tests</strong> where I use an object oriented way to  write acceptance tests, but here is a tip from it.</p>

<p>If you want full control do the Capybara wire-up yourself.</p>

<p>First we create a context object, which will hold our session.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>test_user.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestUser</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">RSpec</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Matchers</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Capybara</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">DSL</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Capybara</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">RSpecMatchers</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can do testing like a Boss!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;My Page&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:user</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">visit</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s1">&#39;shows a logout button&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">have_link</span> <span class="s1">&#39;logout&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s1">&#39;shows a product information box&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">have_selector</span> <span class="s1">&#39;#infoBox&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice the missing <code>:type =&gt; :acceptance</code>. Here the <code>Capybara::Session</code> will be embedded in the TestUser instance, instead of the Nested class which is created by RSpec and thus will work across tests.</p>

<h2>The token authorization solution</h2>

<p>Another even faster to implement solution for some people is to have token authorization.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-29T09:59:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pzol.github.com/pzol/blog/2012/01/29/object-oriented-acceptance-tests-basics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have had a very hard time to understand <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> to do acceptance testing. I was amazed by executable documentation, from the moment I heard the word. It bears the promise of a lean documentation. A documentation which is part of the actual software being built.</p>

<p>For me living documentation is a way to describe, thus define or in other words specify a system.</p>

<!-- find a better word for system -->


<p>This will be a series of short articles. The first one will be about the theory. The second will start with real code.</p>

<h2>User Stories and Use Cases</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='who? what? why? '>
User stories should be written so that they express what the user actually expects.<br/>
They are about describing what it looks like from the point of view of an actor being part of a narrative.
Stories answer the very important questions who? what? why?. The last-mentioned is actually the most important one.</p>

<p></span></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='how? what? '>
Use cases are very important, too. They describe the same thing, but from a different perspective.
Use cases tell us more about how? what?
</span></p>

<h2>Context - Action - Outcome</h2>

<p>Given - When - Then</p>

<p>When setting up a context - verify it has been really setup, this is really important as you will know you are starting from the right spot, it will tell you early, that something is wrong with your environment, and not yet in the action or the outcome.</p>

<h2>Types of Tests</h2>

<p>Acceptance
: Does the whole system work?</p>

<p>Integration
: Does our code work against the code we can&#8217;t change?</p>

<p>Unit
: Do our objects do the right thing, are they convenient to work with?</p>

<h2>Elements of acceptance tests</h2>

<ul>
<li>should exercise the system end-to-end</li>
<li>should see the system as it is seen by the user</li>
<li>should provide a documentation for later</li>
<li>should be coded in a clean way</li>
</ul>


<h2>Start on a Sunny Day</h2>

<p>Write your first scenario, you can name it &#8216;Sunny Day&#8217; at first, so you don&#8217;t have to think about the name to much. As soon as you work on it and realize a better name, change it accordingly.</p>

<h2>Then go into the Deviations</h2>

<h2>User Intentions vs System Responsibility</h2>

<h2>Staying Productive</h2>

<p>This is maybe a little off-topic, but maybe you find it useful.</p>

<p>While writing this project I used <strong>OmniFocus</strong> to keep a backlog of things to do. Every time something I wanted or needed to do crossed my mind, I put it on the list.
<strong>Vitamin-R</strong> and <strong>Pomodoro</strong> helped me to stay focused on the tasks. After finishing each task, I review my todo list and add new tasks which I think need to be done and change or delete existing tasks. Looking at the list I redefined the next most important task which would enable me to show my work to the public.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Experience vs Attitude]]></title>
    <link href="http://pzol.github.com/pzol/blog/2011/02/14/experience-vs-attitude/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-14T14:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pzol.github.com/pzol/blog/2011/02/14/experience-vs-attitude</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When interviewing new people for a job as an agile developer, what qualities should you be looking for?
Is it sufficient to check the previous experience and the knowledge in the areas he will be needing for your projects or is the attitude more important?</p>

<h3>Attitude</h3>

<p>A developer is like an engineer, always looking for improvement, always trying out new things and trying to make his work more productive,
at the same time he is proud of his work and makes sure it works properly. What has made him act this way is his attitude.</p>

<p>Then you have programmers, which simply translate instructions into code.</p>

<p>I like the word developer, as it derives from development, according to the dictionary, to develop means <em>to grow or cause to grow and become more mature, advanced, or elaborate</em>.
Hence a developer is somebody who <strong>causes some application to grow and become more advanced</strong>. A programmer just translates ideas into code. This is not enough.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology">wikipedia</a>, attitude is</p>

<blockquote><p>An attitude is a hypothetical construct that represents an individual&#8217;s degree of like or dislike for something.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another view of what attitude is comes from buddhism, there we have the <a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html">Eightfold Path</a>,
which is the way to end suffering, i.e. achieve Nirvana.
In terms of software to reach Nirvana, is to end all suffering coming from maintaining legacy project.</p>

<p>An excerpt says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles of the path.
Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can be achieved,
whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its task,
and confusion will be the consequence.
Mental energy is the force behind right effort; it can occur in either wholesome or unwholesome states.</p></blockquote>

<p>For me in our context this means, that somebody needs to <strong>be determined to do the right thing</strong>
and that attitude or the right effort is the prerequisite to become a great developer.</p>

<p>In real life a developer needs to behave accordingly in all kind of daily situations.
As our team becomes more cross-functional, not only in terms of specialization on programming languages or special areas of expertise within the area of coding,
a developer needs to have the right <strong>likes</strong> of the following areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Quality - A developer needs to have the right attitude to automate deployment, so that every time her work is put into production it works flawlessly.
Quality means predictability, that said, a developer needs to work on a proper test suite, making sure what was working once, doesn&#8217;t get broken accidentally.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer Value - what we build must be valuable for the customer, developer must avoid creating waste and
<strong>communicate</strong> with the customer directly to make sure to have the same common understanding of value.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Learning - a developer must always learn new things, in his technology, programming language and also in other areas like databases, operating systems etc.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Then on the other hand there is experience, which is the sum of a person has learned, of all mistakes he did, of everything good or bad,
that happened in his life.</p>

<p>If you are building a new team or a new project where you have no expertise yet, you might want to lay more emphasis on experience and hire people,
which have already done what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>We all learn by trial and error, especially software engineers need to see for themselves what is working and what is not.
Then on the other hand, we cannot allow to make mistakes which jeopardize our customers business.</p>

<p>In order to move forward safely, you have to have people which have made a reasonable amount of errors so they won&#8217;t do them on your new mission-critical project.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In my opinion the art (as in martial art) of software development requires people to be truly cross-functional
- in their abilities to learn, to take on tasks which are not necessarily their favorite
and to continuously <em>steal</em> knowledge from other areas in order to keep improving.
Thus, the conclusion for me is straightforward, the right effort or in other words the right attitude, is crucial, specific skill can be acquired along the path.</p>

<p>So in the end, the right answer is - it depends. If you are looking for a long-term investment, and already have a basis,
you might lay less importance on experience and more on the right attitude.</p>

<p>If you do not have a solid foundation in the form of experienced people, you really need to build that first.
You can build good software with unexperienced people, it will take longer and will cost you more,
but with people with a bad attitude you will most probably build bad software, which will be hard to maintain.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Holistic Deployment]]></title>
    <link href="http://pzol.github.com/pzol/blog/2011/02/09/holistic-deployment/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-09T02:14:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pzol.github.com/pzol/blog/2011/02/09/holistic-deployment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your agile team has built great software, only to find out it cannot work in production?</p>

<p>Agile has taken the development community by storm. It has improved our everyday lives. It enables us to build great working software in all kinds of environments.
But for many companies, covering the last mile, bringing an application into production is the biggest obstacle to being truly agile.
Prescribed processes and skill-sets in operations lag behind a decade.
We have created cross-functional teams, excluding one of the most important aspects of of software - it needs to run in production!</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Devs become quicker in delivering releases and new customer value.<br/>
Ops cannot release as often as Devs.</p>

<p>Devs don&#8217;t know or understand production infrastructure.<br/>
Devs develop software that <em>works on my machine</em>.</p>

<p>Ops don&#8217;t do TDD, don&#8217;t automate. Our sysadmins, cannot write code (messy bash scripts is about the max).<br/>
Ops needs days or even weeks to deploy something to production, because of their own queuing.</p>

<p>Separating Dev and Ops creates a waterfall. If anything breaks, the feedback cycle is long!</p>

<h3>Conflict of interests</h3>

<p>Devs and Ops have been created in most organizations to fulfill a separate role. Devs are designed for change. Ops are designed for preservation.
As the organization matures, each department evolves into it&#8217;s own direction and have their own goals, sometimes forgetting they both serve the same purpose.</p>

<p>Product Owners want new value asap - on production - that&#8217;s understood.<br/>
Developers want to release more often.<br/>
Ops want high availability, stability, reliability.</p>

<p>Both Devs and Ops, from their perspective, want the best for the business.
Only, optimizing any subsystem without context, leads to the destabilization of the system as a whole, de facto decreasing overall performance.</p>

<p>Deployment is complex, high risk, error prone and thus holds a risk of destabilization.</p>

<h3>Anti-Patterns</h3>

<p>The reasons why Ops departments were created - at least in our case - because there were some anti-patterns which deteriorated our quality and our reputation with customers.</p>

<ul>
<li>AdHoc Release - Devs would deploy as soon as they made quick fixes to the application.</li>
<li>Production Patching - Sysadmins change configs and other parts directly on production, nobody knows what they changed</li>
<li>Service Monolith - the apps are not modular enough or not modular the way and nobody understood how they work together.</li>
<li>Lack of Automation - the whole deploy process was done manually, every time!</li>
</ul>


<h3>What we need to focus on</h3>

<p>It is <strong>not</strong> about bringing agile practices to operations, this is a must anyway. Although Kanban is ideal for that kind of endeavor,
we do not want only to copy-paste our practices to another department.</p>

<p>We need to focus on the right effort. We are all connected by one purpose,
we all need to take have the right mindset to work together on a product as a whole to provide a tremendous customer service.</p>

<p>Thus we need all to keep in mind what is most important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Business Value</li>
<li>Predictability, Repeatable processes</li>
<li>Stability, Uptime</li>
</ol>


<h3>About DevOps</h3>

<p>The Devops movement has done a good job to bring out, many of the pain-points of the current sysadmin vs developer silo situation.
I have been hoping, that admins and ops will someday understand, that they must do more than install software, hardware and search logs.</p>

<p>I kind of like the word Devops.<br/>
To me it means that sysadmins will be more like developers, adhere to the high standards of developers which have evolved over the last years with xp and agile.
It means to me that automated installation will bring us an repeatable process. No repeating mistakes. Identical production servers. No exceptions.
Setting up new machines will be easy fast thing as bringing new functionality to the software.<br/>
Current Sysadmins must understand, they are like 32bit hardware, to be retired in the near future, unless they adapt and upgrade themselves!</p>

<p>On the other hand, developers must fully acknowledge, that their software is only  if it works in production.
The Definition of Done has to be extended to &#8220;Running of Production&#8221;. Every sprint.</p>

<h3>Duties</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the responsibilities of our two parties.
Despite that Devops want to include QA into their new movement,
I will argue that QA is a duty of both Devs and Ops anyway and thus not talk further about it (either it works or it doesn&#8217;t).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the duties of the different roles in an organization like mine - <a href="http://www.anixe.pl">anixe</a>
- where we develop software for e-commerce to run our customers businesses.</p>

<p>Duties of Sysadmins:</p>

<ul>
<li>Systems &amp; Applications Administration</li>
<li>Infrastructure Management</li>
</ul>


<p>Duties of Ops:</p>

<ul>
<li>24&times;7 Tech Support</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Testing &amp; Quality Assurance (QA)</li>
</ul>


<p>Duties of Dev:</p>

<ul>
<li>Builds &amp; Configuration</li>
<li>Release Management</li>
<li>Testing &amp; Quality Assurance (QA)</li>
<li>Technical Analysis</li>
<li>Technical Project Management</li>
</ul>


<p>What&#8217;s wrong with this picture?</p>

<p>Sysadmins are responsible for Applications - how could they, if they haven&#8217;t built them (just assume changes happen fast)<br/>
Ops are responsible for deployment - cool, but if it doesn&#8217;t work, they&#8217;re helpless without Devs assistance<br/>
Ops are responsible for Testing - ouch - again, they need to be taught what to test and testing and building is not happening in the same iteration<br/>
Devs don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on on production</p>

<h3>Possible Solution for a harmonious together</h3>

<p>This is not just one possible solution, there are others as well, but here is a temporary one we might want to try.
In <strong>this</strong> context, Ops are sysadmins, the rest of Ops should be part of the agile development teams anyway. I just don&#8217;t see how we could integrate admins, which are specialist and only required &#8220;rarely&#8221; once a platform is up and running.</p>

<p>Ops provide a cloud-like environment.
Devs deploy to a transparent cloud-like environment. Devs are responsible for deployment to production!</p>

<p>Cloud-like means, every machine deployed to must be same-same, no matter whether it&#8217;s test, staging or production.</p>

<p>Ops use an automated, repeatable process for system installation. This means coding skills are required by <strong>every</strong> team member.
The same clean code, versioning and other practices must be by every team member.</p>

<p>Continuous integration, build, deployment.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>all environments are guaranteed to be identical</li>
<li>Devs have <em>reasonable</em> access to the infrastructure</li>
<li>Personal User data must be protected and inaccessible</li>
</ul>


<h3>How far have we come?</h3>

<p>Here at <a href="http://www.anixe.pl">anixe</a>, our current workflow looks as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Devs develop software, it is unit and integration tested</li>
<li>One some projects: Admins deploy prebuilt packages including the configuration for the target environment. NO manual editing of config files is allowed, every config for every environment is under source control.
All applications config files are the same. Differences per platform are in a separate configuration file. Database schema changes are bundled in the deploy and run automatically.
We haven&#8217;t figured out how to do automatic data migrations, yet.</li>
<li>On other projects: Ops run an automated deploy script (home-made for .net applications), which takes care of everything, handles backups, rollbacks, etc.</li>
<li>On ruby projects:  We use currently capistrano and Devs deploy themselves. We use here mongo as database, so deployment is easy.</li>
<li>Ops verify if everything went smoothly and notify customers about the outcome</li>
<li>For linux deployments are preparing an installer using <a href="http://babushka.me">babushka</a>, which does test-driven-sysadmin installation.</li>
</ul>


<p>Generally linux deployment is so much easier, a fully automated and test driven platform installation within a couple of days. The same on Windows took us over a month.</p>

<p>After the separation of Devs and Ops we have developed a new anti-pattern which is over the wall deployment. Devs deliver packages and let Ops do the rest.</p>

<p>Now as we are approaching a new age of automation of deployment, we currently face another anti-pattern, and that is that everybody in the organization wants to use their own set of tools.
Some use dos-batch programs, some use VB scripts, some bash scripts and so on.</p>
